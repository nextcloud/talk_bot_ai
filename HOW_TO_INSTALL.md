2. Create a deployment daemon following the [instructions](https://cloud-py-api.github.io/app_api/CreationOfDeployDaemon.html) provided by AppAPI. _(If you are using AIO, it will be created automatically)_
3. Navigate to the `External Apps` menu from your Nextcloud instance, find this app, and click `Deploy and Enable`.
4. In Nextcloud Talk, choose a conversation and enable the bot in `Conversation settings`.
